# About the project
This game was created as a part of master thesis in the field of fine arts. 
The goal was to create a game that would present the idea of emotional support 
animals and how they can help people with mental health issues. The game was 
created in Unity 2019.4.1f1 and the source code is available in the repository.

## Architecture
The code is written with strong focus on readability and maintainability. 
It presents the ideas of using Dependant Injection in Unity 
(in this case it's VContainer check it out here: https://vcontainer.hadashikick.jp/).

The game is divided into independent systems that are responsible for different parts of the game like UI, Audio, etc.
Each system is divided into smaller parts that are responsible for specific tasks.
